<h3 class="keys">About Me</h3>
<p class=about>
I am a Calgary, Alberta native Software Engineering Student studying at the University of Calgary Schulich School of Engineering. My biggest interests are in the fastest growing sectors in software today:</p>
<p class="about">
<b>Cryptography</b> - It is my belief that the future of the civilized world will depend on changes that are happening in the cryptographic space today. I am especially interested in technologies that are developed independently of the United States and Seven Eyes governments including cryptographic functions such as ChaCha20-Poly1305, and protocols such as the Open Whisper System Signal Protocol. Cryptography efficiently provides the world authentication, verification, and privacy. That is to say; it is the only system in the world that guarantees both the freedom and security of its users. At the University of Calgary, I am interested in researching blockchain technologies, such as Ethereum.
</p>
<p class="about">
<b>Machine Learning</b> - Neural Networks and other convolutional systems will allow for unbiased learning that drives us to the limits of discovery. Applications for media, science, and business are easily tangible and will be readily available in the future. At the University of Calgary, I am interested in researching the use of Machine Learning to analyze music discovery and music synthesis.
</p>
<p class="about">
<b>Distributed Computation</b> - Although current implementations of the distributed computation such as "The Cloud" and other "Services as a Service" are high points of profit for the industry today, blockchain technology allows for communal and mesh-network like distributed computation that will allow for a real revolution in how Internet services are supported and monetized. At the University of Calgary, I am interested in researching the growth of Ethereum and its applications.
</p>
<p class="about">
Beyond these sectors, I am an individual who finds himself interested in a wide array of topics. For fitness, I am interested in natural bodybuilding and weightlifting. A large part of my relaxation time is spent playing strategic card games such as Magic: The Gathering. Most importantly, I love leaving the city and computers behind to venture into hiking and camping in the nearby Rocky Mountains. To learn more about my adventures in these worlds, please visit my blog, or take a peek at my Twitter.</p>
<p class="about">
If any of these topics also interest you, I would be awesome to have an opportunity to work with you. For a more in-depth look at my work experience and education, please visit my LinkedIn or send me an E-mail. If privacy is of a concern, I am available to be reached using Signal, Riot, or Wire, and have also provided a public PGP key. </p>
